This project was realised at Military Academy of Technology in Warsaw during Database Systems Laboratories.
I used Neo4j Database System to execute this code downloaded from: https://neo4j.com/.
# Execution

2. To run this project copy every line and paste it to the textfield, then click 'run'.
3. For SQL Server database you need to open file in MS SQL Server and execute it.
